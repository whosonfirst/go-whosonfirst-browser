# go-whosonfirst-hash

Go package for working with hashes in Who's On First documents

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.6 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Important

This is almost certainly not a general purpose package. It is shaped like the day-to-day needs of Who's On First in mid-2017...
